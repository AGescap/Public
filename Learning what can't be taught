I have always(1) wondered how coding can be taught. I've attended at most, one proper coding course, I would say...

Well, let's start from scratch. My first step into programming was at my first year in the university, in the second semester. The course
aimed at teaching the basics of computation (bytes, memory, data type...) and then starting with proper coding. The language in which the
course was based on was C. Now I know that C is a high-level programming language, which means that declaring the type of the variables is
mandatory. I am just starting ("always starting" is a concept I will extend on later) but I feel that it is advisory that the first contact
with a programming language is done with a statically typed one. The main reasons i would bring up are:

   -It does not leave the student "fly free", but locks him/her in cage that is spacious enough.
   -It gives the student the intuition that "things are hard".
